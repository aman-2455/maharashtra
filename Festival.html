                            Main Diwali Day: The third day is the most significant. It commemorates the return of Lord Rama to Ayodhya after 14 years of exile and his victory over the demon king Ravana, symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. On this day, people worship Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and Lord Ganesha, the god of wisdom. Homes and streets are decorated with colorful rangoli designs, flowers, and rows of lit diyas. Fireworks light up the night sky, adding to the festive atmosphere.
